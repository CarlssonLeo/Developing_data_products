```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup


```{r cars, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
leaflet() %>% 
	addTiles() %>%
	addMarkers(lat=57.730557, lng=12.013839,
		   popup = "Best town")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
