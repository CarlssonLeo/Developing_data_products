```
## Intro
This is the document for week three of the JH Coursera course developing data products, where I make a presentation and a plotly plot. I use the Ames housing dataset to plot the year sold, the sale price, coloured by it's condition. 

## Plot
```{r cars, echo = FALSE}
plot_ly(ames, x = ~year_sold, y= ~SalePrice, color = ~Sale_Condition)
```
