## A problem
How to teach students concept that are hard to grasp? How a log transformation affects a regression model assumption is often hard to grasp by intuition, and while it is one of the most used treatments to non-normal data, it's often not really understood. 

## Its often hard to differentiate what this is...
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qog %>% ggplot(aes(log(mad_gdppc)))+
                geom_histogram()
```

## Compared to this
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
qog %>% ggplot(aes(mad_gdppc))+
                geom_histogram()
```

## The solution?
A webapp! By letting students visualise the difference the difference of a common skewed data in a regression with or without a log-transformations, they better understand the difference.
